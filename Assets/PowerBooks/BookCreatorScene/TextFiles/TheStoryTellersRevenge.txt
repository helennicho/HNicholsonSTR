The Protaginists’ Journey

Are you feeling tired, stressed or maybe just bored?
Are you in need of a relaxing or uplifting experience,
A change of scenery, or a  change of weather?
Or just a desire to escape from the everyday grind 


Looking for an adventure or a challenge?
Or just a desire to escape from the everyday grind.
Perhaps you are dreaming of sand and surf.

Freedom to explore beautiful hills & mountains
Exploring places near or far
Or maybe just to travel the seas


Well ...
The opportunity is right here.
You don’t even need to leave your home.
Click on the vacation box.
And if that’s not your idea of a vacation.
Pop back to the main scene.

Click on the blue box for a starter for one,
If you like blue waters and want to travel the seas.
Or you can just exit now – if you can find the port

This IS also the Storyteller's Revenge
